		<h1>IT Autobiography</h1>

            <p>My name is Ruben Cuyvers. I’m 17 years old and I go to the Immaculata Instituut. I live in Rijkevorsel. </p>

            <p>
Before the age of 13 we had a PC at home but after the first grade I got my own PC. When I wanted to do something and I had problems with it I went to search on the internet. The information that I found was very interesting. At first I didn’t understand a lot of PC’s but now I know a lot of them. Most of the sites I visited were forums with most of the time the answers I needed. I remember the first time I opened my laptop to clean the vent, I had really no idea what all these parts were. So when we were learning the components of a PC I could relate to the parts I had seen.
                </p>

IT is a very big part of my life. But I think that is normal when you have 10 hours a week of IT related lessons. I think I spend about 2 hours a day on my PC but that depends from day to day. Sometimes it’s way more or in other cases I don’t even touch my PC. There is also an evolution between a few years ago and now. I used to be less on the PC than now. Most of that time I gamed but I also liked to try things like Photoshop, video editing, video converting,… I know a lot about PC’s but I don’t think I’m an expert. I can work pretty well with PC’s but there are so many things I don’t know anything about. We learned all the components and how the PC works but I still have the feeling that I don't know much about how it works. We know which part does what but we don’t know exactly how it does it. I recently made my own pc and I couldn’t have done it without help. I know what parts I need but I had really no idea what I should spend on the different parts.
I have really no idea what I want to do in my future. I know I want to do something with IT because I’m very interested in it. And someone’s goal for the future should be making your work from your hobby or interests. I don’t really know which direction I want to go: in the direction of software or more hardware and network related.
                </p>
        <br><p>
So I use my PC a lot so it would be hard living without it. It really became a part of me. I use it for everything: homework, gaming, watching movies and more. It’s strange to know my life would be completely different if the PC wasn’t invented. The only thing I want to reach is having a job that I love doing.
